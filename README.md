This Assignment Explores:

• Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Gridworld Scenario
• Value Iteration & Policy Extraction 
• Q-Learning - implementing methods to learn from experiences via updates from interactions with the environment.
• Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - epsilon-greedy action selection strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
• Approximate Q-Learning - to handle larger state spaces with feature-based methods for generalization across states.
    • Feature Extraction - extracting features from state-action pairs to facilitate learning in complex environments.
